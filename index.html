                                Our preschool program is designed to allow children to study alongside them. 
                                We utilise the children's interests as indications for programming directions 
                                and expand on their curiosity. This curriculum is fully unstructured, allowing 
                                children to learn and grow at their own speed without fear of being judged.

                                Our redesigned nursery education program aids in the development of children's 
                                school ready skills. Pre-literacy skills, building self-reliance and independence, 
                                and socialising via play are all topics we focus on. To better prepare them for a 
                                successful introduction into the school system, we urge youngsters to begin developing 
                                problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

                                Our school-aged curriculum is meant to give kids an open-ended area 
                                to explore the new and exciting ideas and concepts they're learning about 
                                every day. We use group projects and clubs to focus on greater long-term 
                                learning objectives here. We plan a variety of activities during the summer 
                                and during school breaks, ranging from field trips to art and craft classes.
